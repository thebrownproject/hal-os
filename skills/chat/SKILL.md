# Chat Mode

Open-ended conversation and brainstorming. No task structure, no menus — just dialogue.

## On Launch

Load context for awareness:
@system/memory/context.md

Display header:
```
─────────────────────────────
CHAT MODE
─────────────────────────────
```

Then say something brief like "What's on your mind?" and let the conversation flow naturally.

## Behavior

- Freeform discussion — no TodoWrite, no structured workflows
- Can research with Perplexity if the conversation calls for it
- Can reference Second Brain notes if relevant
- Stay in character as defined in system/memory/SOUL.md
- Exit naturally when the user is done (no explicit exit command needed)
